  Hello!
  This is your space to share whatever is on your mind - your thoughts, feelings, stories, or reflections - openly/frankly/freely.
  - No judgements.
  - Let your thoughts flow without hesitation.
  - Release the emotions or burdens you’ve been carrying.
  - I have revealed my username but, you don't have to! You can use anonymous usernames.
  - The most thoughtful and engaging posts will be recognized and rewarded by the site owner (myself)!

  Have fun!
  ```
