              Inspired by Reddit, but repelled by its negativity, noise and
              doomer mindset, Zerely is a safe space to vent your thoughts,
              emotions, and experiences anonymously. You can comment advice or
              even some kind words on other posts and support each other. Zerely
              exists because people were never meant to carry everything by
              themselves.

              'The Contract' is an imaginary arc that changed everything for its
              creator, Aravind A Kamath. For years, ideas were trapped behind
              overthinking - perfection delaying progress, paralysis by analysis. Until one moment forced a decision: stop waiting, stop
              hesitating, and start building. Zerely
              is the result of that arc - proof that the hardest step is
              simply beginning.
              <br />
              <br />
              Sometimes all it takes is one decision to change your life. So
              take a breath. And when you're ready - experience Zerely!
